# Python in Java (PyJava)
## Creator: Starlinkboy

A versatile way to use python commands in Java however semi-colon( ; ) is still necessary.

**NOTE: PyJava is still under development and is not completed. If you wish to contribute contact Starlinkboy below.**
## Functions
1. print() - Prints query.
 2. input() - inputs as string printing text in ("");
 3. int_input() - similar to input but integer
 4. char_input() - similar to input but character
 5. double_input() - similar to input but double
 6. exit() - exits the program
 7. time_sleep() - puts the terminal to sleep as per the amount of seconds mentioned in (); Note: Do not use "" inside ();
 8. os_system() - Executes operating commands. 
     -> cls - Usage: os_system("cls") = Clears terminal

9. Color - To add color to your text use the following syntax:

   ```print(COLOR+"text or variable"+variable+RESET);```

   Example:
   ``` print(RED+"Hi"+RESET); ```
## How does it work
PyJava relies on functions to allow the usage of python-like commands. Function overloading and other such methods are used.
